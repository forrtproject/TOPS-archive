# TOPS-archive

This is an archive of the TOPS project as of March 2025, when it had to move away from its previous home due to the political landscape. For the same reason, we had to remove the list of contributors from this version. Once the individual contributors have been able to confirm whether they wish to be named or to be removed, we will add a file of contributors here.

This repository contains:
- The former zenodo repository containing the five modules
- A jupyter book version of the TOPS guide

This will be turned into a read-only archive version and will not be updated. 

FORRT is planning to convert the jupyter book into a Quarto book, and then invite collaboration on that - yet the project naturally continues to be CC-BY-licenced, so that all contributors and other parties are welcome to take it forward in other directions.
